# food-order-app

This app is a front-end project designed for React hook practice.  I may come back to it to add a useEffect, but at this moment it was not necessary.

User can choose an item on the menu to add to their cart.  The cart badge will automatically update, and if you click on the cart it will open.  The open cart gives you a total amount, as well as the option to add or remove items in the cart. The "Order" button only shows up if you have something inside of your cart, but does not have any function added to it.  The "Close" button is always there, and will close your cart.  User may also click anywhere on the screen to close their cart.

Download the file, run npm install and npm start to see it in action.
